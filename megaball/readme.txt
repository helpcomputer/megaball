Gameplay

The goal of the game is to roll the ball over every flashing panel to complete the stage.

There are 15 stages that become increasingly more difficult, presenting you with tougher terrain and more enemies to avoid.

For each stage you complete you gain one extra life.

Your main aim should be to avoid enemies, but if you need to you can use your special weapon which will cause you to self-destruct and shatter into 10 pieces, killing any enemy which collides with these pieces. You will immediately re-spawn, and the enemy will reappear in 5 seconds.
